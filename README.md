# ECG Classification with Deep Learning

This repository implements advanced ECG heartbeat classification using the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database. The project features hybrid BiLSTM-CNN models with attention mechanisms, digital signal preprocessing, and efficient data handling optimized for 12GB RAM.

## Features
- ECG signal preprocessing with bandpass, notch, highpass, and lowpass filters.
- Extraction of heartbeat segments with class mapping according to AAMI standards.
- Training of deep learning models including BiLSTM-CNN with attention.
- Enhanced handling of class imbalance.
- Comprehensive evaluation with detailed metrics and visualization.
